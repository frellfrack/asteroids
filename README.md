Asteroids Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Asteroids game, written in Python 3 using the Pygame library. The game consists of a space ship that the player controls, and various asteroids that move around the screen and must be avoided or destroyed. The player can fire projectiles to destroy the asteroids, and must navigate through the space avoiding collisions and incoming asteroids.

Requirements
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 and the Pygame library installed. You can install Pygame by running:

pip install pygame
Usage

To run the game, simply execute the asteroids.py file with Python:

python asteroids.py
